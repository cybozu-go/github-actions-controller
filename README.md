# meows

`meows` is a Kubernetes controller for GitHub Actions [self-hosted runners](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/hosting-your-own-runners/about-self-hosted-runners).
You can run jobs in your GitHub Actions workflows on your Kubernetes cluster with meows.

**Project Status**: Initial development

## Supported software

- Kubernetes: 1.20, 1.21

## Features

- Run a self-hosted runner on a pod
  - We call the pod `runner pod` :)
  - You can customize the runner pod spec. E.g., labels, annotations, environment variables, volumes, and other specs.
- Run GitHub Actions jobs in the clean environment
  - meows only runs one job on a single runner pod.
    When a job has finished, meows will delete the runner pod to which the job is assigned and create the new one.
    So you can always run a job on a clean runner pod.
- Pool and maintain some self-hosted runners
  - meows prepares multiple runner pods as you specified.
- Extend the lifetime of runner pods
  - When a job has finished, meows will delete the assigned runner pod after a while.
    But if necessary, you can extend the lifetime of the runner pod.
    For example, it enables you to do a failed investigation of a job.
  - Currently, you can only extend it if a job has failed.
